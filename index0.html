            <h3><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Health Education</h3>
            <p>Explore resources on preventive care and healthy living.Maintaining a healthy lifestyle involves several key components. 
                Firstly, a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, and healthy fats is crucial, while minimizing 
                sugar, salt, and processed foods. Regular exercise is also essential, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity
                 or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, including muscle-strengthening exercises. Staying hydrated by drinking plenty 
                 of water throughout the day is important for overall health. Quality sleep, ranging from 7 to 9 hours each night, is vital
                  for both mental and physical well-being. Additionally, mental health should not be neglected; practices like mindfulness,
                  meditation, and hobbies can help manage stress. Regular check-ups with healthcare providers ensure early detection and better 
                  management of health issues. Lastly, avoiding harmful habits such as excessive alcohol consumption and smoking is imperative.
                   By incorporating these practices, one can maintain a healthy and fulfilling¬†life.</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Local Services Education</h3>
            <p>Learn about local healthcare services available in your community.Local healthcare services form the backbone of community 
                wellbeing, offering various levels of care to meet diverse medical needs. At the foundation of these services are primary
                care providers, including family doctors and general practitioners, who serve as the first point of contact for most medical 
                concerns. These physicians build long-term relationships with patients, providing routine checkups, preventive care, and
                 managing chronic conditions while coordinating with specialists when necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For immediate medical needs, communities are served by both emergency rooms and urgent care centers. Emergency rooms, 
                    available 24/7, are equipped to handle life-threatening conditions and severe injuries, with advanced diagnostic equipment
                     and specialized trauma teams. Urgent care centers bridge the gap between primary care and emergency services, offering
                      extended hours and walk-in care for non-life-threatening conditions that require prompt attention.
